# timed-code-quiz
This is my project for a timed multiple choice coding quiz with high score storing capabilities. 

The quiz is based around javascript and HTML. It counts down from 100 and will deduct 10 seconds for each wrong answer.
At the end the timer is stopped and captured when the user enters their initials, this number is the score. Basically 
all of the website is built out using javaScript, with a few containers in the HTML for the dynamic items to be stored in.

This website needs improvement in that it skips questions because of an unsolved logic problem, but I will be working on it.
